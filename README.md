# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis 📉

This project analyzes customer churn behavior using a telecom dataset to identify key factors influencing customer retention and churn. The goal is to uncover actionable insights through data visualization and statistical analysis.

## 🔍 Objective
To analyze customer churn patterns based on:
- Contract type
- Payment method
- Tenure
- Senior citizen status
- Monthly charges
- Internet service type

## 📊 Key Visualizations Included
- **Churn Rate by Contract Type**: Identifies which contracts have the highest risk of churn.
- **Churn Rate by Payment Method**: Highlights riskier payment options (e.g., electronic checks).
- **Churn vs Tenure Trend**: Line plot showing how churn risk decreases over time.
- **Senior Citizens vs Churn**: Stacked bar showing retention risk for senior users.
- **Monthly Charges by Churn**: Box plot to reveal billing pressure on churners.
- **Heatmap: Contract x Payment Method**: Visualizes combined churn risks.
- **Internet Service vs Churn**: Shows service types linked to higher churn.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ✅ How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Ensure all dependencies (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`) are installed.
3. Run all cells to see the full analysis and charts.

## 📌 Summary of Findings
- Customers on **month-to-month** contracts and using **electronic checks** are far more likely to churn.
- Churn is highest within the **first year of tenure**.
- **Senior citizens** are at a significantly higher churn risk.
- **Fiber optic** users churn more than DSL users.
